## Counterparty credit risk in the trading book
55.1 Banks must calculate the counterparty credit risk charge for over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, repo-style and other transactions booked in the trading book, separate from the capital requirement for market risk. ${ }^{1}$ The risk weights to be used in this calculation must be consistent with those used for calculating the capital requirements in the banking book. Thus, banks using the standardised approach in the banking book will use the standardised approach risk weights in the trading book and banks using the internal ratings-based (IRB) approach in the banking book will use the IRB risk weights in the trading book in a manner consistent with the IRB roll-out situation in the banking book as described in CRE30.45 to CRE30.52. For counterparties included in portfolios where the IRB approach is being used the IRB risk weights will have to be applied.
