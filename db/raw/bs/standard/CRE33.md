## Introduction

33.1 This chapter sets out the calculation of risk weighted assets and expected losses for specialised lending (SL) exposures subject to the supervisory slotting approach. The method for determining the difference between expected losses and provisions is set out in CRE35.

## Risk weights for specialised lending (PF, OF, CF and IPRE)

33.2 For project finance (PF), object finance (OF), commodities finance (CF) and income producing real estate (IPRE) exposures, banks that do not meet the requirements for the estimation of probability of default (PD) under the corporate internal ratings-based (IRB) approach will be required to map their internal grades to five supervisory categories, each of which is associated with a specific risk weight. The slotting criteria on which this mapping must be based are provided in CRE33.13 for PF exposures, CRE33.15 for OF exposures, CRE33.16 for CF exposures and CRE33.14 for IPRE exposures. The risk weights for unexpected losses (UL) associated with each supervisory category are:

| Supervisory categories and unexpected loss (UL) risk weights for other SL exposures |  |  |  |  |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Strong | Good | Satisfactory | Weak | Default |
| $70 \%$ | $90 \%$ | $115 \%$ | $250 \%$ | $0 \%$ |

33.3 Although banks are expected to map their internal ratings to the supervisory categories for specialised lending using the slotting criteria, each supervisory category broadly corresponds to a range of external credit assessments as outlined below.

| Strong | Good | Satisfactory | Weak | Default |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| BBB- or better | BB+ or BB | BB- or B+ | B to C- | Not applicable |

33.4 At national discretion, supervisors may allow banks to assign preferential risk weights of $50 \%$ to "strong" exposures, and $70 \%$ to "good" exposures, provided they have a remaining maturity of less than 2.5 years or the supervisor determines that banks' underwriting and other risk characteristics are substantially stronger than specified in the slotting criteria for the relevant supervisory risk category.

## Risk weights for specialised lending (HVCRE)

33.5 For high-volatility commercial real estate (HVCRE) exposures, banks that do not meet the requirements for estimation of PD, or whose supervisor has chosen not to implement the foundation or advanced approaches to HVCRE, must map their internal grades to five supervisory categories, each of which is associated with a specific risk weight. The slotting criteria on which this mapping must be based are the same as those for IPRE, as provided in CRE33.14. The risk weights associated with each supervisory category are:

| Supervisory categories and UL risk weights for high-volatility commercial real estate |  |  |  |  |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Strong | Good | Satisfactory | Weak | Default |
| $95 \%$ | $120 \%$ | $140 \%$ | $250 \%$ | $0 \%$ |

33.6 As indicated in CRE33.3, each supervisory category broadly corresponds to a range of external credit assessments.

33.7 At national discretion, supervisors may allow banks to assign preferential risk weights of $70 \%$ to "strong" exposures, and $95 \%$ to "good" exposures, provided they have a remaining maturity of less than 2.5 years or the supervisor determines that banks' underwriting and other risk characteristics are substantially stronger than specified in the slotting criteria for the relevant supervisory risk category.

## Expected loss for specialised lending (SL) exposures subject to the supervisory slotting criteria

33.8 For SL exposures subject to the supervisory slotting criteria, the expected loss (EL) amount is determined by multiplying $8 \%$ by the risk-weighted assets produced from the appropriate risk weights, as specified below, multiplied by exposure at default.

33.9 The risk weights for SL, other than HVCRE, are as follows:

| Strong | Good | Satisfactory | Weak | Default |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| $5 \%$ | $10 \%$ | $35 \%$ | $100 \%$ | $625 \%$ |

33.10 Where, at national discretion, supervisors allow banks to assign preferential risk weights to non-HVCRE SL exposures falling into the "strong" and "good" supervisory categories as outlined in CRE33.4, the corresponding expected loss (EL) risk weight is $0 \%$ for "strong" exposures, and $5 \%$ for "good" exposures.

33.11 The risk weights for HVCRE are as follows:

| Strong | Good | Satisfactory | Weak | Default |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| $5 \%$ | $5 \%$ | $35 \%$ | $100 \%$ | $625 \%$ |

33.12 Even where, at national discretion, supervisors allow banks to assign preferential risk weights to HVCRE exposures falling into the "strong" and "good" supervisory categories as outlined in CRE33.7, the corresponding EL risk weight will remain at $5 \%$ for both "strong" and "good" exposures.

FAQ

FAQ1 How can banks reflect climate-related financial risks in the Supervisory slotting criteria for specialised lending?

When performing the assessment of the category of the subfactor components, banks should analyse how climate-related financial risks could negatively impact the assignment into a category. This includes any potential impact on the financial strength (eg estimations of the future demand, economic assumption and stressed economic conditions used for stress analysis), the political and legal environment (eg transition risk into "stability of legal and regulatory environment (risk of change in law)", physical risk into "Force majeure risk (war, civil unrest, etc)" and the asset characteristic in the case of object finance. When performing this assessment, banks should take into consideration whether climate-related financial risks have been adequately mitigated (eg improving adaptation or taking insurance coverage against physical climate risks).
